# NightShift.exe API Backend
API for **NightShift.exe**, a tournament game for the SorSU Bulan Campus library. CS 313 Software Engineering 1, A.Y. 2026-2027.
- Developer: Jedriane Golpeo (jedrianegolpeo05-sketch), BSCS 3-1
- Group and game concept: g1-nightshift
This is my own build of my group's game concept. Every commit in this repository was made by me, with Git, on my own computer or in my own Codespace.

## Tech stack
| Layer | Tool |
|---|---|
| Runtime | Node.js 22 LTS or newer |
| Web framework | Express 5 |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 or newer |
| ORM and migrations | Sequelize 6 with sequelize-cli |

## Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/jedrianegolpeo05-sketch/g1-nightshift-backend-jedriane-golpeo.git
cd g1-nightshift-backend-jedriane-golpeo
npm install
```
Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, then put your own PostgreSQL password in `DB_PASSWORD`.
```
npm run db:create (first time only)
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed
npm run db:check
npm run dev
```

## Environment variables
| Key | Example | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| NODE_ENV | development | Which config block to use |
| PORT | 3001 | Port the API listens on (the library assigns the final port at deployment) |
| DB_HOST | 127.0.0.1 | PostgreSQL host |
| DB_PORT | 5432 | PostgreSQL port |
| DB_NAME | nightshift_exe | Database name: your game slug, with underscores |
| DB_USER | postgres | Database user |
| DB_PASSWORD | (your own) | Database password. Never commit this. |
| HUB_API_KEY | dev-hub-key | Key the Library Game Hub sends to read results. The library gives the real one at deployment. |

## Endpoints (Hub Contract v1.2)
Base URL: `http://localhost:3001/api/v1`
| Method | Path | Purpose | Success |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | /health | Is the API up and can it reach the database? | 200 (503 when the database is down) |
| GET | /game-info | Slug, name, group, developer, description, player limits, version | 200 |
| GET | /results | Finished games, every player, and the top 3. Needs the `X-Hub-Key` header. Optional `?since=` | 200 (401 without the key) |

## What "completed" means in my game
A player completed the game when they survived from 00:00 to 06:00 or got a jumpscare by DAEMON. Both outcomes end the night and count as completed.

## Tables
PLAYER - stores player profiles
GAME_SESSION - stores each played session
NIGHT - stores one DAEMON cycle within a session
CAMERA_EVENT_LOG - stores camera viewed/corrupted/fixed events
SCORE - stores best night reached and total survival time

## Database scripts
| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| npm run db:migrate | Runs migrations that have not run yet |
| npm run db:migrate:status | Lists every migration as up or down |
| npm run db:seed | Loads the seed data |
| npm run db:check | Counts the rows in every table |
| npm run db:reset | Empties the database, rebuilds every table and reloads the seed data |
| npm run check | Runs the same automatic check that GitHub runs after every push |
